# DasNet
DasNet is a new multi-task learning framework to accelerate inference speed.
In this project we provide DasNet framework and apply this method on ImageNet and Birds200. Dataset also includes MIT67 and CatVsDog. 
To demonstrate the accuracy of our approach, we compared the recent popular pruning methods to a baseline. Specifically, the comparison 
algorithm has Taylor prune(Pruning convolutionalneuralnetworksforresourceefﬁcienttransferlearning), ThiNet( Thinet: A ﬁlter level pruning method for deep neural network compres
sion) and AutoPruner(Autopruner: An end-to-end trainable ﬁlter pruning method for efﬁcient deep model inference). Figure 1-3 shows our results.
